            On May 17, 2022, a precious little angel was born. And on July 16th,
            after showing us that she was the most playful and cutest of all the
            options, she came home with us and we couldn't be happier. We don't
            have words to describe how many challenges, love and joy she has
            brought into our lives. She's a busy little bugger, always making
            noise, trying to get your food and seeking attention, but somehow
            she's just perfect. She's made mummy start going on walks up to
            twice a day, even in the rain and made mummy buy a car, and overcome
            the fear of driving after a car accident and also she was with mummy
            while she was learning how to do this website.
